# WaveFunctionCollapse
 Simple Wave Function Collapse Program

Just run Program to see The Wave Function... Collapse

NOTES: RED = That is the next index to update
       Purple = That is a possible next index to update
       IMPORTANT = visualizing the function only works if it fits on screen
        - for large grids just chose no visualize option
